# Sodor Island 3D 2009 (January 2012)
![](https://github.com/Zeldaboy14/SI3D-2009/blob/main/docs/img/banners/header.jpg?raw=true)

A (nearly) complete archive of SI3D 2009 as it stood in January 2012. Features content archives too
that I added in thanks to some anon's who assisted in file hunting. This WILL NOT host anything for
SI3D 2010 or the early 2012 range as those are outside the scope (and probably not even allowed still)
